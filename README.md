# Recommendation System

Our recommendation system will offer you the products or services that users are interested in and consume. Rationale is that users of Lifelong Education Website Chiang Mai University tend to choose the same course frequently since they aren't well advertised. Learners can be both students and people of all ages. Theory is to create an algorithm to allow users to access programs that meet their needs. We will use Python to create a backend system that can deploy with websites such as Netflix, Agoda, Amazon, etc.
